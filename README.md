# Audio Analysis for YouTube and Spotify

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of complex audio track data, encompassing attributes such as tempo, valence, energy/liveness, danceability, etc., on both YouTube and Spotify platforms. The analysis is conducted through the utilization of SQL and Python, and the results are visually represented on interactive dashboards created with Tableau.

## Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
In the Python notebook, the datasets underwent thorough cleaning, which included the application of statistical measures to fill in NaN values and feature engineering to identify and remove unnecessary columns.

## Data Analysis using Python and SQL
Subsequently, exploratory data analysis was conducted, and data analysis using SQL queries was performed, incorporating sub-querying and partitioning techniques.
